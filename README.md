# traveling_politician
 An adaption of the Traveling Salesman Problem. In this problem, instead of having the same start and end points, the politician starts in a state capital and ends in Washington D.C. I was provided with a csv of all zipcodes in the United States, with each zipcode's city, state, longitude, and latitude.
